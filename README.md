## Overview

This repository contains code for training a deep learning model to detect pneumonia in medical images using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is designed for binary classification of chest X-ray images into "normal" and "pneumonia" categories.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset for training and validation.
- **Model Building**: Define the deep learning model architecture.
- **Early Stopping**: Implement EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Training**: Train the model and track training metrics.
- **Visualization**: Visualize dataset, predictions, and training metrics.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Compute and plot a confusion matrix for evaluation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-detection.git

## Training

Execute the code to train the pneumonia detection model. Customize hyperparameters as needed.

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model using provided visualization functions and the confusion matrix plot.

## Usage

Use the trained model for pneumonia detection on new chest X-ray images.



## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries and frameworks installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn (for the confusion matrix)
